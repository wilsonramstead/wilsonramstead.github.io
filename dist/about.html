            <h2 class="text-secondary">3 Technology Stacks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>M.E.A.N Stack:</strong> MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, Node.</li>
                <li><strong>C# Stack:</strong> ASP.NET, Entity Framework and SQL.</li>
                <li><strong>Python Stack:</strong> Django/Flask and MySQL.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To pass each stack exam: Required to build a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) website application in the above technologies, in a 5 hour time limit with a series of requirements.</p>
            <p>We learned three different full stack packages, to get a better understanding of how the same concepts carry between different languages. My favorite Stack by far is M.E.A.N stack, due to the powerful technology of Angular -- I've built most of my side projects using this.</p>
